This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Firebase's onAuthStateChanged method.  The problem arises from the improper handling of the unsubscribe function, leading to persistent listeners and potential memory leaks.  The `authBug.js` file showcases the erroneous code, while `authBugSolution.js` provides the corrected implementation.  The solution emphasizes the importance of consistently unsubscribing from listeners within the useEffect cleanup function to prevent resource exhaustion.
